Idea: Event Manager
The "Event Manager" is a web app that helps users log and manage events. Its really as
simple as that nothing complicated. Its used for keeping track of the events that have
passed or upcoming events in the “Events” tab. Users can:
● Add new events (name, date, time, location, description).
● View a list of all events.
● Edit or delete existing events with a confirmation dialog for deletion.
You can edit or delete the event in case the plans change.
